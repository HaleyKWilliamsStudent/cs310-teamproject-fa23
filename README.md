# About:
This repository contains all of the necessary files for a digital Time and Attendance System, intended for internal use by a local company/business. <br />
Rudimentary business and data logic are implemented using DAOs (data access objects), providing a layer of abstraction for the purposes of database implementation. <br />
While the scope of this project only encompasses the constituent libraries, these libraries are intended to later be integrated into a clock terminal control system and/or a Web-based application.
